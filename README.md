# mMass

This is a fork of the official repository for mMass on Python3.

This version contains fixes that allow it to launch using modern Python and updated requirements. Currently it works on Linux.

For more information please see the official mMass homepage at [www.mmass.org](http://www.mmass.org).  Many thanks to Martin Strohalm for his hard work on the project over many years!

## Acknowledgements (from original repo)

Many thanks to the [FINDER](https://www.shh.mpg.de/453199/finder) project for sponsoring the recent overhaul
work, through whom the software has been made runnable on Python3 and
WxWidgets Phoenix.

Thanks also to [Warriner Lab](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/warinnerlab) for providing support and testing, and
funding the updated MacOS installer.


## Building from source
### Linux

(We will use UV instead of poetry)

mMass uses [poetry](python-poetry.org/) as the build system.  To get started ensure poetry is [installed](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation), then clone the mMass repository.

Due to this [well-known issue](https://wxpython.org/blog/2017-08-17-builds-for-linux-with-pip/index.html), the wxPython toolkit must be compiled from scratch.  Poetry will handle this, but you require the build dependencies.

Ensure all the [dependencies for building wxPython](https://wxpython.org/blog/2017-08-17-builds-for-linux-with-pip/index.html) are installed on your system.  For Fedora GNU/Linux (32), this is currently:
```
python3
python3-devel
gtk3-devel
gstreamer1-devel
freeglut-devel
libjpeg-turbo-devel
libpng-devel
libtiff-devel
SDL-devel
libnotify-devel
libSM-devel
```

For Debian, this is currently:
```
python3
python3-dev
freeglut3-dev
libwebkitgtk-3.0-dev
libjpeg-dev
libpng-dev
libtiff-dev
libsdl-dev
libnotify-dev
libsm-dev
```

From within the repository, install the dependencies into the _venv_ with:

`poetry install`

Don't be surprised if installing wxPython takes a long time: the entire UI toolkit is being compiled from source.

Run the software:

`poetry run mmass`

Build software packages with:

`poetry build`

Your packages will be built within the `dist/` directory.

### Windows
Microsoft Windows does not come with a C compiler built in.  Since mMass uses a Python extension module, written in C, to speed up certain calculations, we must first install Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0 (or newer).

Go to the [Visual Studio downloads page](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/), and download Visual Studio 2019 (or newer) Community edition.  Run the installer.

You will be presented with a list of packages to install.  Under the `Workloads` tab, select Desktop development with C++, and in the sidebar ensure that the MSVC option is selected.

You might also want to use this installed to install Python onto your machine, if you haven't already done so.

Ensure you have installed the [poetry build system](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation), clone the mMass repository.

From within the repository, install the dependencies into the _venv_ with:

`poetry install`

Run the software:

`poetry run mmass`

Build software packages with:

`poetry build`

Your packages will be built within the `dist/` directory.


### MacOS

NB: mMass is currently known to not build correctly on M1 silicon, because of [this upstream issue](https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow/issues/5093).  Once Python3.9 is supported on MacOS by default, it will become possible to build a new package supporting M1.

mMass uses [poetry](python-poetry.org/) as the build system.  To get started ensure poetry is [installed](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation), then clone the mMass repository.

You may need to add the poetry install location to your shell's $PATH depending on the install method.

From within the repository, install the dependencies into the _venv_ with:

`poetry install`

Run the software:

`poetry run mmass`

Build software packages with:

`poetry build`

Your packages will be built within the `dist/` directory.

## Packaging
Before proceeding with packaging steps, first ensure that you've built mMass from source on your current machine.

### Linux

(this is not how it will be set up as I could not really get it to work)

We currently only compile mMass for x86_64.  This must be done using [manylinux](https://github.com/pypa/manylinux) to maintain ABI compatibility between versions.

Firstly, get a fresh build environment container.  We're using [podman](https://podman.io):

```
podman pull quay.io/pypa/manylinux_2_24_x86_64
podman run -i quay.io/pypa/manylinux_2_24_x86_64
podman ps # To get CONTAINER ID
podman exec -it [CONTAINER ID] /bin/bash
```

And then within the container:
```
cd /root
git clone https://github.com/dreamingspires/mMass
cd mMass
```

Now install and build the repository:
```
apt update
apt install -y python3-pip libgtk-3-dev gstreamer1.0 gstreamer1.0-plugins-base freeglut3-dev libwebkitgtk-3.0-dev libjpeg-dev libpng-dev libtiff-dev libsdl-dev libnotify-dev libsm-dev libwebkitgtk-dev

python3 -m pip install --user poetry
python3 -m poetry env use /opt/python/cp37-cp37m/bin/python3

python3 -m poetry install  # This will probably take a while
poetry build
```

To prepare a release for pypi, see [this guide](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/#uploading-the-distribution-archives).  In summary:

```
poetry install
poetry build
python3 -m twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*
python3 -m twine upload --repository pypi dist/*
```

### Windows

(not a priority)

Ensure that `makensis` is installed:

```
choco install nsis.portable
```

Build the executable in `dist/`.  From the root directory of the repo:

```
poetry install
poetry run pyinstaller .\installer\windows.spec
```

Build the installer in `dist/`.  From the root directory of the repo:

```
makensis.exe /DPRODUCT_VERSION=0.1.0 installer\windows_installer.nsi
```

### MacOS

(I don't use the walled garden computers, so probably won't be done)

From within the installed project directory:

```
poetry run python3 installer/mac_setup.py py2app
```

The resulting application will be built inside `./dist/mMass`.

Finally, package the application into a `.zip` archive for easier distribution.  You can do this by launching `Finder`, right-clicking on the application, and selecting `Compress "mMass"`.
